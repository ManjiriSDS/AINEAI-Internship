# 🌐 Aine AI Internship

## 🛠️ Project Overview
During the internship, I worked on several projects that focused on:
- **Data Manipulation:** Techniques to clean, transform, and structure data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends within datasets.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing datasets to understand the underlying distributions and relationships.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementing basic machine learning models to predict outcomes based on data.

This experience allowed me to strengthen my skills in handling real-world data challenges and to apply analytical techniques effectively.

## 🚀 About the Internship
The Aine AI Internship provided a platform to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, enhancing my understanding of data science principles and their applications in various scenarios.
