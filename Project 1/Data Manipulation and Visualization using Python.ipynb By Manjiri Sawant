It will take multiple smaller datasets or will create dataframes to teach important concepts that we use in common data manipulation and visualization.\n","\n","The project will be focused around the use of Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries of Python programming. In a professional setting, you would work on larger datasets however, the same concepts are going to be applied on smaller datasets in this project."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f4syIiTwzImo"},"source":["# How to work on this project\n","\n","Since it is more of a training module, you are required to read the concepts and concepts written and follow the instructions to answer the questions or get desired output.\n","\n","Suggested resources and links are mentioned in the Notebook for certain concepts. You can open the links and read/watch the content to get an understanding of the concepts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BFCkNDPCyt2S"},"source":["# Pandas in Python\n","\n","Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. \n","\n","When the values are in a table, the table in Python programming is called a dataframe. \n","Basically, dataframes are nothing but variables with values in structured data format.\n","\n","Pandas library is used to view, manipulate (modify) and analyse dataframes which are 2-D or 3-D in nature."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Oy2DTaIN0lon"},"source":["# Matplotlib in Python\n","\n","Matplotlib is a plotting library in Python.
